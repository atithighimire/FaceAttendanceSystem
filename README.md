# FaceAttendanceSystem
Among several biometric methods, face recognition is one of the ways to identify any individual subject, making it a demanding technology 
in variety of area including student attendance systems. When attendance is done manually it generally wastes a lot of productive time of the class.
The proposed solution for this problem is through automation of attendance system using face recognition.
Face Attendance System describes the method of detecting and recognizing the face in real-time. This system is built by four modules – Face Detection,
Face Training, Face Recognition and Attendance Database. The system is initially trained with the students’ faces. This project uses modified algorithm of 
haar cascades proposed by Viola-Jones for face detection and Local binary patterns histograms for face recognition. The system stores the attendance in database
using MongoDB and csv file for tracking student details and attendance detail. The system uses user friendly User interface to maximize the user experience
for detection, training, recognition and attendance parts. Face Attendance System largely help reduce the manual labor and discrepancies otherwise involved 
in traditional attendance process.
